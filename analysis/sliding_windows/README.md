# Sliding Window Analyses  

We compared CNV counts between cases and controls across all 22 autosomes in regularized sliding windows. This process is described below.  

The code to reproduce these analyses is contained in `sliding_window_analysis.sh`.  

### Data curation  

Steps taken for data curation are described elsewhere. Please see the README available in the [the `data_curation/` subdirectory](https://github.com/talkowski-lab/rCNV2/tree/master/data_curation/).
