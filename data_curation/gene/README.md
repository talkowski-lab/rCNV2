# Gene Curation  

We curated and annotated all protein-coding genes in the genome for association testing. This process is described below.  

All commands executed to filter the CNV data as descrbed below are contained in `format_genes.sh`.    

## Gene definitions  

We restricted all gene-based analyses to canonical transcripts from autosomal protein-coding genes as defined by [Gencode v19](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_19.html).  

The Gencode definition of "canonical transcript" is [provided here](http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Glossary?id=346).  

We extracted all canonical transcripts from protein-coding genes using `get_canonical_transcripts.py`.   

## Exon-level expression filtering  

We also restricted all gene-based analyses to exons expressed in at least 20% of transcripts in at least one human tissue catalogued by the [Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project](https://gtexportal.org/).  

For this filter, we computed the per-exon max `pext` score as defined in [Cummings _et al._, _bioRxiv_ (2019)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/554444v1) across all available tissues.  

Bases from exons with missing `pext` scores were ignored when calculating mean `pext` scores, and exons entirely missing `pext` scores were considered as passing.  

Genes with no exons remaining after exon-level expression filtering were removed outright from all subsequent analyses.  

## Gene features  

For certain analyses, we used per-gene features across a variety of categories.  

These "gene features" are described below.  

For each feature set, we controlled for inter-feature correlation structure by decomposing all features with principal components analysis and retaining the top "eigenfeatures" that explained at least 99% of inter-gene variance.  

In practice, the feature collection and decomposition process was parallelized in [FireCloud/Terra](https://portal.firecloud.org) with `get_gene_metadata.wdl`.

### Eigenfeature calculation  

Following annotation of all features described above, we collapsed correlated annotations to retain the principal components, or "eigenfeatures," that captured at least 99% of inter-gene variance.  

Prior to principal components analysis, we normalized the data in two steps, as follows:  
1. All variables were transformed using Box-Cox power transformations (unless otherwise specified in the table below), and
2. Following transformation, all variables were centered (mean = 0) and scaled (standard deviation = 1).  

Exceptions to Box-Cox power transformations are listed below:  

| Feature | Transformation | Reason |  
| :--- | :--- | :--- |  
| All `expression_component` features | None | By definition, features defined as principal components of other data need no additional transformation |  
| All `chromatin_component` features | None | By definition, features defined as principal components of other data need no additional transformation |  
| All de novo mutation data from ASC & DDD | None | Mutation counts are too sparse for transformation |  
| All Z-score features | None | By definition, Z-score features need no additional transformation |  
| All gnomAD-SV mutation count data | None | Mutation counts are too sparse for transformation |  
| All BCA counts from Redin _et al._ | None | Mutation counts are too sparse for transformation |  
| gnomAD constraint probabilities (pLI, pRec., pNull) | None | Beta-distributed probabilities are not well suited for power transformation |  
| `promoter_phastcons` | None | Data not well suited for power transformation |  


## Gene set definitions  

Throughout our analyses, we reference various subsets of genes. These are defined below.  

Note that all gene sets were required to have a unique match to a gene name from one of the canonical, protein-coding genes curated for this study (as defined above).  

All gene lists in the table below are available from `gs://rcnv_project/cleaned_data/genes/gene_lists/`, which is accessible to users with appropriate GCP permissions.
