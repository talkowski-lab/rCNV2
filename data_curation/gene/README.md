# Gene Curation  

## Gene Curation  

We curated and annotated all protein-coding genes in the genome for association testing. This process is described below.  

All commands executed to filter the CNV data as descrbed below are contained in `format_genes.sh`.  

In practice, the commands in `format_genes.sh` were parallelized in [FireCloud/Terra](https://portal.firecloud.org) with `format_genes.wdl`.
