# CNV Data Curation

We aggregated existing microarray-based CNV calls from 17 sources. This process is described in the methods of Collins _et al._, 2022.  

Example commands executed to filter the CNV data are contained in `filter_CNV_data.sh`.  

In practice, the commands in `filter_CNV_data.sh` were parallelized in [FireCloud/Terra](https://portal.firecloud.org) with `filter_CNV_data.wdl`.
