# Other Data Curation  

Below, we describe curation steps for other datasets not already listed in a different subdirectory, including:  

* Various microarray probesets  
* Structural variant calls from the Human Genome Diversity Panel
* Previously reported genomic disorders  
* Predicted NAHR-mediated CNV loci  
* _De novo_ point mutations from exome sequencing studies of neurodevelopmental disorders
* Balanced chromosomal abnormality breakpoints from sequencing studies of congenital anomalies

Curation steps for these datasets are described in detail in the methods of Collins _et al._ (2022).
