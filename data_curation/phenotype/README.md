# Phenotype Data Curation

We grouped samples into phenotype-matched subsets using a standardized hierarchical ontology. This process is described in the methods of Collins _et al._, 2022.  

Example commands executed to curate and cluster phenotypes are contained in `convert_phenotypes_to_hpo.sh`.
