## Docker containers

This sudirectory contains Dockerfiles supporting all analyses conducted in this project.  

In practice, all users should refer to the `rcnv` Docker image for all analyses.

A public copy of this Docker image is hosted on Google Container Registry here:
```
gcr.io/gnomad-wgs-v2-sv/rcnv:latest
```

The other image, `rcnv-base`, is simply a base image built separately for convenience and can be ignored for most purposes.
